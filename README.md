# Word Frequency

## Directions

In this project, you will use `open` to read in a text file and calculate the frequency of words in that file.

To calculate the frequency of words, you must:

- remove punctuation
- normalize all words to lowercase
- remove "stop words" -- words used so frequently they are ignored
- go through the file word by word and keep a count of how often each word is used

When your program is complete, you should be able to run `python3 word_frequency.py praise_song_for_the_day.txt` and get a printed report like this:

```
     we | 7 *******
   each | 5 *****
     or | 5 *****
   need | 5 *****
   love | 5 *****
  about | 4 ****
 praise | 4 ****
   song | 4 ****
    day | 3 ***
    our | 3 ***
```

## Starter Files

A starting program is located in `word_frequency.py`.
